NAME
      Kwiki::UserName::Auth - Online user regsitration plugin for Kwiki

SYNOPSIS
      # Replce other UserName plugin with Kwiki::UserName::Auth
      % vim plugins
      # Use Kwiki::Users::Auth as a alternative of Kwiki::Users
      % echo "users_class: Kwiki::Users::Auth" >> config.yaml
      % kwiki -update

DESCRIPTION
    For people who want to have a little control over their Kwiki site
    visitors, this is the plugin for them. It provides a registration
    process for users, instead of just a preference field in the preferences
    page. User are asked to give their email address and password to login.

    It only works with Kwiki::Users::Auth, which could read proper account
    information from cookie after user login. So you must edit your
    config.yaml and put this line in:

      users_class: Kwiki::Users::Auth

    Please remove or comment any other lines if they also set users_class.

    Upon registration, user are asked to fill 3 fields: email, display name,
    and password. email and password are required as they are used to
    identify a particular user. The display name is optional, if it's not
    given, it would be the account name (anything before '@') in the email
    address..

CAUTION
    This plugin is still in early alpha. Which means it's still too early to
    be deployed to any production site. Use at your on risk, and give me
    help if you want.

    So far the password are stored in clear text.
